# Architecture Decision Records

These records were **reconstructed on 2026-08-13** by a fleet-wide ADR sweep that
recovered Solidago's architectural decisions from commit history, issues and PRs,
`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/reference-notes.md`, and session archives. They were not written
at the time each decision was made. The **Status** date on each record is the
*original* decision date (verified against the evidence cited inside); the
"reconstructed 2026-08-13" note records when the ADR itself was written.

Each record's **Alternatives** section distinguishes options that were actually
weighed at the time (drawn from the cited evidence) from options marked
*"retrospective — not considered at the time"*, which are assessed here with
hindsight and were **not** part of the original decision.
