# Adopting Solidago

Solidago is a Terraform project that stands up a complete, three-tier AWS
environment you own outright: a VPC with public/app/data subnets across two
availability zones, an Application Load Balancer (ALB) fronting containers on
ECS Fargate, a PostgreSQL database (RDS) and a Redis cache (ElastiCache), plus
IAM/OIDC, secrets, DNS/TLS, monitoring, and CI/CD wired together. When you
finish, you have a real AWS account running a real load-balanced web service on
your own domain, deployed by GitHub Actions with no long-lived cloud
credentials stored anywhere. It is a *platform*, not a single app — one shared
ALB and ECS cluster host several small static sites side by side.

What it is **not**: it is not serverless or free-tier. It runs paid, always-on
infrastructure (NAT gateways, an ALB, RDS, ElastiCache) that costs real money
by the hour — see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) — so the
[Teardown](#teardown) section is not optional reading. A registered domain is
mandatory: TLS certificates (AWS Certificate Manager, "ACM") and DNS
(Route 53) are load-bearing, not add-ons.

**Status of this runbook:** never run against a fresh account —
**unexercised**. See [Receipt](#receipt).

## What you get

- A production-shaped AWS environment defined entirely in Terraform, in one
  repo you control.
- HTTPS on your own domain, terminated at the ALB with an auto-renewing ACM
  certificate.
- Container deploys via GitHub Actions using OIDC federation — **no AWS access
  keys are ever stored** in GitHub.
- A selective teardown/standup pair of scripts so an idle lab costs pennies a
  day instead of ~$4.50 (see [Teardown](#teardown)).

| What | Who owns it |
|---|---|
| The repository | You (fork it) |
| The AWS account it runs in | You |
| The data (RDS, state bucket, secrets) | You |
| The domain(s) | You |
| The container images / site content | You (they live in separate workload repos you also own) |

Nothing in the running stack is owned or hosted by Lentago Labs. The reference
estate ships coupled to *our* account, domains, and a few external SaaS
integrations (Grafana Cloud, Axiom, Anthropic) — every one of those is listed
in the [Swap list](#swap-list) and every SaaS one is optional.

## What this is not

- **Not a managed PaaS.** You operate the AWS resources; Terraform only defines
  them. There is no control plane hiding the load balancer or the database from
  you.
- **Not multi-region or highly available across regions.** It is two
  availability zones in one region (`us-east-1` by default).
- **Not free, and not safe to leave running unattended.** Continuous cost is
  ~$130/month; an abandoned stack keeps billing until you tear it down.

## Prerequisites

Everything you need, in one list. No hunting through other repos.

- **Accounts:**
  - An **AWS account** with root/admin access (you will create IAM roles).
  - A **GitHub account**, and an **organization or user** that will own your
    fork and the workload repo(s). CI authenticates to AWS as that org via
    OIDC, so the org name is baked into an IAM trust policy.
  - An account at a **domain registrar** where you can edit nameserver (NS)
    records — the reference stack's domains are registered at Squarespace, but
    any registrar works.
- **A registered domain — mandatory.** ACM and Route 53 are not optional in
  this stack; the ALB will not serve HTTPS without a validated certificate, and
  validation happens through a Route 53 hosted zone you delegate your domain
  to. A single domain is enough to start.
- **Hardware:** any machine that runs the CLIs below. Nothing special.
- **Tools:**
  - **Terraform ≥ 1.10** — state locking is S3-native (`use_lockfile`), which
    is a 1.10+ feature. Older Terraform will fail to lock.
  - **AWS CLI v2** — configured with a profile or the default credential chain.
  - **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** — for creating the environment and inspecting
    Actions runs.
  - **git**, configured with your identity.
- **Access you must already have:** AWS admin credentials on your machine
  (`aws sts get-caller-identity` must succeed); permission to edit NS records
  at your registrar; admin on your GitHub repo (to create an Environment and a
  branch-protection ruleset).
- **Optional integrations** (all skipped cleanly if you leave them blank):
  - **Grafana Cloud** — set `grafana_cloud_account_id` / `_external_id` to
    create a read-only cross-account metrics role; leave both `""` to skip the
    module entirely.
  - **Anthropic API key** — powers the optional "Ask the Wiki" Lambda; blank
    deploys it in a degraded state (returns 502) rather than failing.
  - **Axiom** — the reference stack ships container and ALB logs to an Axiom
    dataset. This is *not* yet parameterized behind an on/off flag; see the
    [Swap list](#swap-list).

**Cost:** **~$130/month running continuously**, dominated by the two NAT
gateways (~$65/mo combined). Other line items: ALB ~$16, RDS ~$15, ElastiCache
~$12, Fargate ~$10, WAF ~$8–9, the rest (Route 53, CloudTrail, Config, KMS,
S3) ~$5. The selective teardown in [`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/RUNBOOK.md) drops
the always-on resources when the lab is idle, bringing a mostly-idle lab to
**roughly $40/month**. Budget alerts fire by email at 50/80/100% of a
$100/month threshold.

**Time:** BOOTSTRAP estimates ~45 minutes for a fresh account with a registered
domain, plus DNS-propagation and ACM-validation wait time (usually under an
hour, occasionally up to ~75 minutes on a cold delegation). This drill has not
yet been independently timed — see [Receipt](#receipt).

## Intake

Every value you must supply lives in one file:
[`environments/dev/terraform.tfvars.example`](environments/dev/terraform.tfvars.example).
Copy it to `environments/dev/terraform.tfvars` (which is gitignored) and fill in
the answers. The third column names the exact variable each answer becomes.

| Question | Your answer | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| Short name for all AWS resources? (default `solidago` is fine) | | `terraform.tfvars` → `project` |
| Which deployment tier? (default `dev`) | | `terraform.tfvars` → `environment` |
| Which AWS region? (default `us-east-1`) | | `terraform.tfvars` → `aws_region` |
| An unguessable single-label subdomain for the first preview site | | `terraform.tfvars` → `lentago_preview_host` |
| A second unguessable subdomain for the second preview site | | `terraform.tfvars` → `pondview_preview_host` |
| Grafana Cloud AWS account ID (optional; blank to skip) | | `terraform.tfvars` → `grafana_cloud_account_id` |
| Grafana Cloud External ID (optional; blank to skip) | | `terraform.tfvars` → `grafana_cloud_external_id` |
| Anthropic API key for the Ask Lambda (optional; blank = degraded) | | `terraform.tfvars` → `anthropic_api_key` |

Some values are **not** Terraform variables — they are hardcoded into the
backend config, the CI workflow, and the root module. Those are handled in the
[Swap list](#swap-list) below, not here.

## Swap list

These are the opinionated values carried over from the reference estate. Find
and replace every one — an un-swapped value here is the failure mode this
section exists to prevent. "Mechanical" means *put your value in and move on*.
Where a value cannot be cleanly parameterized, the row says so and points at the
tracking issue.

Tracked in [#188](https://github.com/lentago/solidago/issues/188) |
| Monthly budget threshold `$100` | `environments/dev/main.tf` (`module.budgets`) | Your budget | mechanical |

**On plan cleanliness:** the reference repo's CI plans are *not* clean — three
ECS task definitions and one SNS subscription always show as pending changes
because live deploys run ahead of Terraform. That drift is tracked in
[issue #184](https://github.com/lentago/solidago/issues/184). Your **first**
plan against a fresh account is all creates and free of that noise; the same
drift will appear only after you deploy a container image and re-plan. When a
drill step below says "check the plan," read it with #184 in mind — those three
task-definition replacements are known and not your error.

## The drill

Numbered, one action per step, **local-first**: everything you can verify
offline comes before anything that touches AWS or costs money. Placeholders are
`<LOUD>`. If a check does not go green, stop — the next step assumes it worked.

| # | Step | Check it's green | ✅ |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Install the tools. `terraform version`, `aws --version`, `gh --version`, `git --version`. | Terraform reports **≥ 1.10**; AWS CLI reports **v2**; all four print a version. | |
| 2 | Fork/clone the repo and `cd solidago`. | `git remote -v` shows your fork. | |
| 3 | `cp environments/dev/terraform.tfvars.example environments/dev/terraform.tfvars` and fill in the [Intake](#intake) values. | `grep -R "change-me" environments/dev/terraform.tfvars` returns **nothing**. | |
| 4 | Work the [Swap list](#swap-list): replace the account ID, domain, and GitHub org; delete the extra site/apex/Axiom blocks you don't want. | `grep -R "365184644049\|icecreamtofightwith\.com\|cjp-solidago" environments .github` returns only your values (or nothing). | |
| 5 | Validate locally, no backend, no AWS calls: `cd environments/dev && terraform init -backend=false && terraform validate`. | Prints **"Success! The configuration is valid."** | |
| 6 | Bootstrap the state backend (first AWS touch; a bucket + a KMS key, pennies): `./scripts/bootstrap/bootstrap-backend.sh`, then set your account ID in `environments/dev/backend.tf`. | `aws s3 ls s3://<YOUR_PROJECT>-tfstate-<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>` succeeds. | |
| 7 | Real init + plan: `terraform init` then `terraform plan`. | Plan completes and shows **only creates** (a fresh account has no drift — see #184). | |
| 8 | First apply from your machine (creates the OIDC provider + app deploy role; ~10–15 min): `terraform apply`. | Apply succeeds; `terraform output` shows `route53_name_servers` and `github_actions_role_arn`. | |
| 9 | Delegate DNS: set your registrar's NS records to the `route53_name_servers` output. | `dig NS <YOUR_DOMAIN>` returns the four Route 53 nameservers. | |
| 10 | **⚠️ Identity-provider bootstrap — the trip hazard. See the warning below.** Create the Terraform-pipeline IAM role by hand and `terraform import` it (three imports), per [BOOTSTRAP Step 7](docs/BOOTSTRAP.md#step-7-create-the-terraform-pipeline-iam-role). | `terraform plan` reports **No changes** for the imported role/policy/attachment. | |
| 11 | Create the GitHub `terraform` Environment and a `main` branch-protection ruleset requiring the Terraform Plan check ([BOOTSTRAP Steps 8–9](docs/BOOTSTRAP.md#step-8-create-the-github-environment)). | Repo → Settings shows the `terraform` environment and the ruleset. | |
| 12 | Verify the pipelines: open a trivial PR (plan runs), merge it (apply runs) ([BOOTSTRAP Step 10](docs/BOOTSTRAP.md#step-10-verify-the-pipelines)). | The PR's **Terraform Plan** check is green; the post-merge **Apply** completes. | |

**If a check does not go green,** stop at that step and see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Verify it works

The end-to-end proof is a page served over HTTPS from your own domain:

- `curl -I https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>` returns **HTTP/2 200** with a valid,
  non-self-signed certificate (your browser shows the padlock, no warning).
- The request is being load-balanced: the response comes from an ECS Fargate
  task, not a placeholder — the ALB target group shows **healthy** targets in
  the AWS console (or via `aws elbv2 describe-target-health`).
- If you kept the monitoring module, a metric arrives: the CloudWatch dashboard
  for your ALB shows request count climbing after your `curl`s.

A green CI run is *not* the proof — the page actually loading is.

## Receipt

**Status: unexercised.** No one has yet run this drill start-to-finish against

above are unproven, not that they are zero.

## Teardown

Removing this stack is a first-class operation, documented in full at
[`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/RUNBOOK.md). Two modes:

- **Selective teardown** (day-to-day): `scripts/teardown.sh` destroys only the
  expensive always-on resources (NAT gateways, ALB, Fargate tasks, ElastiCache;
  RDS is *stopped*, not destroyed) and keeps the durable foundation, so
  `scripts/standup.sh` brings it back in minutes. This is how you park an idle
  lab at ~$40/month equivalent instead of ~$130.
- **Full teardown**: `terraform destroy` from `environments/dev` removes
  everything Terraform manages. The state bucket and its dedicated KMS key are
  bootstrapped *outside* Terraform and are deliberately **not** destroyed —
  they cost pennies and hold your state.

**Confirm the billing actually stopped.** This is the section a non-profit
should trust the rest of the document by, so verify it explicitly:

- `aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways --filter Name=state,Values=available` returns
  **empty** — NAT gateways are the largest line item and bill until deleted.
- `aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers` returns **no** ALB (full teardown) or the
  expected count.
- `aws rds describe-db-instances --query 'DBInstances[].DBInstanceStatus'`
  shows **`stopped`** (selective) or the instance is gone (full). A *stopped*
  RDS instance still bills for storage and auto-restarts after 7 days — take a
  snapshot and use `RDS_MODE=destroy` to stop all RDS charges.
- In **Cost Explorer** (or `aws ce get-cost-and-usage` for a daily
  granularity), the daily cost drops to near-zero within a day or two. This is
  the definitive check — a resource you forgot shows up here as a line that
  never goes to zero.
- After a **full** teardown the only resources left should be the state S3
  bucket and the `alias/<project>-tfstate` KMS key. Anything else still running
  is a leak — chase it in Cost Explorer.

## You are operationally ready when

- [ ] `https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>` serves your app with a valid certificate
- [ ] Deploys run through GitHub Actions via OIDC — no AWS keys in the repo
- [ ] The RDS instance is reachable from the app and you have **taken and
      restored a snapshot** at least once
- [ ] Budget/alarm emails reach a human inbox you actually read (confirm the
      SNS subscription — see [issue #184](https://github.com/lentago/solidago/issues/184))
- [ ] `terraform.tfvars` holds *your* secrets, and no `change-me` placeholder or
      example value remains
- [ ] You have run `scripts/teardown.sh` and `scripts/standup.sh` at least once
      and confirmed billing dropped in Cost Explorer
- [ ] Someone other than you can follow this document from a clean clone

## Troubleshooting

Real failures seen bringing this stack up, symptom first.

**Symptom:** `terraform apply` hangs for a long time on
`aws_acm_certificate_validation`.
**Cause:** DNS is not delegated yet, so ACM cannot see the validation records.
**Fix:** Complete drill Step 9 (set the NS records at your registrar) and wait
for propagation; validation can take up to ~75 minutes on a cold delegation.

**Symptom:** ECS service creation fails with *"target group does not have an
associated load balancer."*
**Cause:** A cold-start race — the HTTPS listener isn't up yet because ACM is
still validating (issue #50). The root module already declares the ordering
dependency; a re-apply after the listener exists succeeds.
**Fix:** Re-run `terraform apply` once the certificate is `ISSUED`.

**Symptom:** State operations fail with `AccessDenied` on a KMS key even though
S3 permissions look right.
**Cause:** The state bucket is SSE-KMS encrypted with the dedicated
`alias/<project>-tfstate` key, whose policy delegates authorization to IAM. A
role reading state needs an explicit `kms:Decrypt`/`GenerateDataKey`/`DescribeKey`
grant on that key ARN.
**Fix:** Confirm the role has the KMS grant (the CI roles get it via
`modules/iam`); a human running locally needs admin or the same grant.

**Symptom:** `terraform plan` in Step 10 shows the Terraform-pipeline role being
**destroyed and recreated** instead of "No changes."
**Cause:** The `terraform import` didn't match — usually the OIDC `sub`
condition or an import address is off.
**Fix:** Compare your role's trust policy to BOOTSTRAP Step 7 exactly, correct
it, and re-import.

**Symptom:** Every CI plan shows three ECS task definitions "must be replaced"
and an SNS subscription being created.
**Cause:** Not your error — live deploys run ahead of Terraform. Tracked in
[issue #184](https://github.com/lentago/solidago/issues/184).
**Fix:** Expected on the reference estate; a fresh account only sees it after
its first container deploy. Confirm the SNS email subscription once so alerts
deliver.
