# Secrets Manager — Credential Storage Pattern
#
# This established the pattern used for all application secrets (Axiom
# ingest headers below reuse it). It was originally a placeholder intended
# to hold RDS credentials once Phase 4 landed.
#
# STATUS: unused / orphaned. Phase 4 (modules/rds) chose RDS-managed master
# passwords instead (Decision #19, docs/reference-notes.md) — RDS creates
# and rotates its own `rds!db-...` secret, so this secret's placeholder
# value is never read by anything and no live credentials are ever written
# to it. It is still provisioned and still IAM-readable (modules/iam grants
# both ECS roles GetSecretValue on it), but nothing in this repo references
# it via `valueFrom` or otherwise consumes it. Disposition (leave vs.
# repurpose vs. remove) is tracked in issue #20; this comment only documents
# the current state, not a decision.
#
# Why Secrets Manager over SSM Parameter Store (SecureString)?
# - Native secret rotation support (Lambda-backed)
# - Cross-account sharing capabilities
# - RDS, Redshift, and DocumentDB have built-in rotation integrations
# - JSON secret values (store username + password + host in one secret)
# SSM Parameter Store is cheaper ($0 vs $0.40/secret/month) but lacks
# the rotation machinery. For a lab demonstrating production patterns,
# Secrets Manager is the right choice.

# IMPORTANT — this stores a BARE token, NOT the "Authorization Bearer <token>"
# header form of axiom_ingest above. That sibling holds the Fluent Bit header
# string verbatim because FireLens needs it as-is. betula's Python shipper
# (clients/aws/alb-logs/alb_shipper/axiom.py) instead reads a BARE token from
# the AXIOM_API_TOKEN env var and builds the "Bearer <token>" header itself, so
# storing the header form here would produce a broken double-"Bearer" header.
# The "-header" name suffix mirrors the sibling for discoverability only.
