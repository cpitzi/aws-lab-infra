# MONITORING: SNS + CLOUDWATCH ALARMS
#
# This module creates:
#   1. An SNS topic as the central notification channel
#   2. An email subscription (requires manual confirmation via inbox)
#   3. CloudWatch metric alarms for each tier of the architecture:
#      - ECS Fargate (CPU, memory)
#      - ALB (5xx errors, target response time)
#      - RDS PostgreSQL (CPU, free storage)
#      - ElastiCache Valkey (engine CPU, memory usage)
#
# Every alarm sends to the SNS topic on ALARM and OK state transitions,
# so you get notified both when something breaks AND when it recovers.
#
# Naming convention: {project}-{environment}-{service}-{metric}
# =============================================================================


# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SNS TOPIC + SUBSCRIPTION
#
# SNS (Simple Notification Service) is a pub/sub message bus. A "topic"
# is a named channel. "Subscriptions" attach delivery endpoints to the
# topic — in our case, an email address. When an alarm fires, it
# publishes a message to the topic, and SNS delivers it to all
# subscribers.
#
# Important: Email subscriptions require manual confirmation. After
# terraform apply, check cpitzi@gmail.com for a confirmation email
# from AWS and click the link. Until confirmed, no notifications
# will be delivered.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# trivy:ignore:AVD-AWS-0095 — deliberately unencrypted for now: the free
# AWS-managed aws/sns key cannot grant cloudwatch.amazonaws.com publish
# rights, so "encrypting" with it silently breaks every alarm feeding this
# topic; doing it right needs a paid CMK. Decision tracked in #180 item 3.

# ALB ALARMS

# These use the AWS/ApplicationELB namespace. The dimension value for
# LoadBalancer is the ALB's arn_suffix (e.g., "app/my-alb/abc123"),
# not the full ARN or the name. This is one of CloudWatch's quirks —
# each service picks its own dimension format.
#
# 5xx alarm: We use the ALB-generated 5xx count (HTTPCode_ELB_5XX_Count),
# which catches errors from the ALB itself (502 Bad Gateway when targets
# are unhealthy, 503 Service Unavailable when at capacity, 504 Gateway
# Timeout). This is distinct from HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count which counts
# 5xx responses from your application code.
#
# Target response time: How long it takes for a target (your ECS task) to
# respond after the ALB forwards the request. Sustained >2 seconds usually
# means something is wrong (resource exhaustion, DB contention, etc.).

# The alarm fires when free space drops below ~4 GiB, giving you time
# to investigate before autoscaling kicks in or storage fills up.

# is more useful than the host-level CPUUtilization for single-threaded
# engines like Valkey/Redis, because a host with 2 vCPUs showing 50%
# host CPU could actually mean 100% engine CPU (one core pegged).
#
# DatabaseMemoryUsagePercentage: How much of the allocated memory is in
# use. When this hits 100%, evictions start happening (or writes fail
# if no eviction policy). Alarming at 80% gives you headroom to
# investigate before data loss.
