# modules/s3/main.tf
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# General-purpose S3 bucket with production security defaults.
#
# Modern Terraform S3 pattern: the bucket itself is a bare resource,
# and all configuration (versioning, encryption, access controls,
# lifecycle) is managed through separate companion resources. This
# is the AWS provider v4+ approach — inline configuration blocks on
# aws_s3_bucket are deprecated and will eventually be removed.
#
# Resources created:
#   1. aws_s3_bucket               — the bucket itself
#   2. aws_s3_bucket_versioning    — object version history
#   3. aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration — KMS encryption
#   4. aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block — all four "block public" settings
#   5. aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration — log rotation + version cleanup
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# AWS only allows ONE bucket policy per bucket. If CloudTrail and Config
# each tried to create their own aws_s3_bucket_policy, the last one would
# overwrite the first. Centralizing here avoids that conflict.
