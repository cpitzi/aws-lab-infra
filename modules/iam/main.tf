# GITHUB ACTIONS OIDC ROLE
#
# This is the authentication mechanism for CI/CD. Instead of storing AWS
# access keys as GitHub secrets (which can leak, don't auto-rotate, and
# give you no way to scope by branch or repo), we use OpenID Connect.
#
# How it works:
# 1. GitHub Actions generates a short-lived JWT token for each workflow run
# 2. The token includes claims: which repo, which branch, which workflow
# 3. AWS has an OIDC identity provider that trusts GitHub's token issuer
# 4. The trust policy on this role says "accept tokens from GitHub, but
#    ONLY from this specific repo" (and optionally, only from main branch)
# 5. GitHub Actions calls sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity with the JWT
# 6. AWS validates the token, checks the trust policy, and issues
#    temporary credentials that last for the workflow run
#
# The result: no long-lived credentials anywhere. Each workflow run gets
# fresh, short-lived creds scoped to exactly what the role allows.
# =============================================================================

# The OIDC provider is an account-level resource — you only need one,
# regardless of how many repos or roles use it. It tells AWS "I trust
# tokens issued by token.actions.githubusercontent.com."

# any other repo's state, or any other AWS service. No GitHub-side
# permissions are granted here; those flow through a separate PAT secret in
# that repo's own CI, not this AWS role.
#
# Trust deliberately does NOT reuse the environment-gated shape of the
# github_actions_terraform role above. Instead it mirrors drosera's
# terraform.yml, which assumes a single Terraform-pipeline role from BOTH its
# plan job (triggered on pull_request) and its apply job (triggered on push
# to main) — see
# arn:aws:iam::365184644049:role/homelab-observability-github-actions-terraform.
# The trust condition below is a list of two subs, OR-matched by
# StringEquals (same technique as github_actions_assume above): the
# push-to-main sub for apply, and the fixed pull_request sub GitHub issues
# for any PR-triggered run regardless of head branch, for plan.
