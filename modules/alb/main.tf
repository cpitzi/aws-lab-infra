# --- Application Load Balancer ---
# The ALB itself is a managed AWS resource that spans multiple AZs.
# Setting internal=false makes it internet-facing (reachable from the public internet).
# It lives in public subnets because it needs a public IP to receive traffic from the internet.
# trivy:ignore:AVD-AWS-0053 — internet-facing by design: this ALB is the public
# entry point for the sites it fronts. The check exists to catch accidental
# exposure of internal assets; this exposure is the product.
